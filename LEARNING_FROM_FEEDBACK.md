# How the AI Work Classification Engine Learns from User Feedback

## 🧠 **Multi-Level Learning Architecture**

The AI Work Classification Engine uses a sophisticated multi-prompt learning system that operates at three levels:

1. **🔄 Real-Time Learning** (Per Classification)
2. **📊 Pattern Recognition** (Every 10 Feedback Items)
3. **🧠 Deep Learning** (Every 50 Feedback Items)

---

## 🔄 **LEVEL 1: REAL-TIME LEARNING (Immediate)**

### **When User Provides Feedback:**

#### **Accept Feedback** (`feedback_type: "accept"`)
```json
{
  "classification_id": "uuid-123",
  "feedback_type": "accept",
  "user_id": "product-manager"
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. **✅ Positive Reinforcement**: Classification stored as successful pattern
2. **📚 Scenario Strengthening**: If matched to scenario, increases scenario confidence
3. **🎯 Context Validation**: Current context marked as effective for this work type
4. **📈 Success Metrics**: Contributes to accuracy tracking and confidence calibration

#### **Edit Feedback** (`feedback_type: "edit"`)
```json
{
  "classification_id": "uuid-123", 
  "feedback_type": "edit",
  "corrections": {
    "complexity": {
      "value": "High",
      "reasoning": "OAuth with enterprise SSO involves extensive security testing and compliance"
    }
  },
  "user_id": "tech-lead"
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. **🔍 Immediate Analysis**: AI analyzes why the correction was needed
2. **🧠 Pattern Detection**: Looks for similar work that might need the same correction
3. **🎯 Context Enhancement**: Adds missing context that would have led to correct classification
4. **📚 Scenario Refinement**: Updates scenario expectations if pattern is consistent

#### **Reject Feedback** (`feedback_type: "reject"`)
```json
{
  "classification_id": "uuid-123",
  "feedback_type": "reject", 
  "additional_context": "This work involves custom protocol implementation, not standard OAuth",
  "user_id": "architect"
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. **❌ Pattern Invalidation**: Classification marked as completely wrong
2. **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**: AI analyzes what went wrong in the classification
3. **📚 Scenario Gap Detection**: Identifies if new scenario is needed
4. **🎯 Context Gap Analysis**: Determines what context was missing

---

## 📊 **LEVEL 2: PATTERN RECOGNITION (Every 10 Feedback Items)**

### **Automatic Pattern Analysis Trigger:**

When the system accumulates 10 feedback items, it automatically triggers pattern analysis using a specialized Claude Sonnet 4 prompt:

```python
async def analyze_feedback_patterns(self, feedback_batch: List[dict]):
    pattern_analysis_prompt = f"""
    You are a Pattern Recognition Expert for AI classification systems.
    
    Analyze these {len(feedback_batch)} feedback items for learning opportunities:
    
    Feedback Data: {json.dumps(feedback_batch, indent=2)}
    
    Identify:
    
    1. **Systematic Correction Patterns**:
       - Work types that consistently get corrected in the same way
       - Missing context that would prevent these corrections
       - Classification rules that need adjustment
    
    2. **Context Enhancement Opportunities**:
       - Context additions that would improve accuracy
       - Dynamic rules that should be created
       - Project-specific patterns to recognize
    
    3. **Scenario Library Updates**:
       - New scenarios needed for unmatched work patterns
       - Existing scenarios that need refinement
       - Examples to add to improve scenario matching
    
    4. **Prompt Optimization**:
       - Prompt adjustments that would reduce correction frequency
       - System message improvements for better accuracy
       - Output format changes for clearer reasoning
    
    Provide specific, actionable improvements with confidence scores.

```

### **Learning Actions Applied:**

#### **🤖 Automatic Safe Improvements** (Applied Immediately)
- **Context Rule Creation**: Add dynamic context rules for detected patterns
- **Scenario Example Addition**: Add successful examples to existing scenarios
- **Confidence Calibration**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on feedback accuracy

#### **📋 Manual Review Queue** (Requires Approval)
- **Scenario Definition Changes**: Major updates to scenario classifications
- **Prompt Modifications**: Changes to system messages or templates
- **Classification Standard Updates**: Adjustments to size/complexity/type criteria

    4. Context standardization across similar scenarios
    
    Goal: Minimize future corrections by improving scenario coverage and accuracy.
    """
    
    return await claude_analyze(evolution_prompt)

## 🔄 **FEEDBACK PROCESSING WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Feedback Collection**
```python
@app.post("/api/feedback")
async def record_feedback(feedback: FeedbackRequest):
    # Store feedback with classification context
    feedback_record = {
        "feedback": feedback,
        "original_classification": get_classification(feedback.classification_id),
        "work_description": get_work_description(feedback.classification_id),
        "context": get_classification_context(feedback.classification_id),
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow()
    }
    
    # Add to feedback store
    engine.feedback_store.append(feedback_record)
    
    # Check if learning threshold reached
    if len(engine.feedback_store) >= engine.config.learning_trigger_threshold:
        await trigger_learning_analysis()
```

### **Step 2: Pattern Recognition**
```python
async def trigger_learning_analysis(self):
    # Analyze recent feedback for patterns
    recent_feedback = self.feedback_store[-self.config.learning_trigger_threshold:]
    
    # Use Claude Sonnet 4 to identify patterns

    for pattern in patterns["high_confidence_patterns"]:
        if pattern["confidence"] > 0.8:
            await self.apply_learning_pattern(pattern)
```

### **Step 3: Learning Application**

## 🧠 **INTELLIGENT FEEDBACK ANALYSIS**

### **Pattern Recognition Prompt** (Used by AI to analyze feedback)

```
You are a Learning Analysis Expert for AI classification systems.

Analyze these feedback corrections to identify learning opportunities:

Recent Feedback: {feedback_data}
Current Scenarios: {scenario_library}
Current Context Rules: {context_rules}

For each pattern of corrections, determine:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Why did the AI make this classification error?
   - What context was missing that would have led to correct classification?
   - Is this a systematic issue or edge case?

2. **Learning Opportunity Assessment**:
   - Can this be fixed with better context rules?
   - Does the scenario definition need updating?
   - Would prompt modifications help?
   - Is a new scenario needed?

3. **Implementation Recommendations**:
   - Specific context rules to add
   - Scenario updates to make
   - Prompt modifications to consider
   - Confidence level for each recommendation

4. **Impact Prediction**:
   - How many similar future classifications would this improve?
   - What accuracy improvement is expected?
   - Are there any risks with the proposed changes?

Provide actionable learning recommendations with implementation priorities.
```

### **Context Enhancement from Feedback**

#### **Missing Context Detection Prompt:**
```
Analyze why this classification needed correction:

Original Work: "{work_description}"
Original Classification: {original_classification}
User Correction: {user_correction}
Correction Reasoning: "{correction_reasoning}"

What context was missing that would have led to the correct classification?

Consider:
- Team experience and velocity factors
- Technology complexity and familiarity
- Business requirements and constraints
- Quality and testing standards
- Risk and compliance factors

Recommend specific context additions that would prevent this correction in the future.
