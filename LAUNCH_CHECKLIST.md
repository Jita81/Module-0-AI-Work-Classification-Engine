#    Description: "AI-optimized module scaffolding framework for rapid development"
#    Public repository
#    Initialize with none (you have everything)

# 2. Connect your local repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/standardized-modules-framework.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 3. Configure repository settings
#    - Enable Issues, Discussions, Wiki, Projects
#    - Set up branch protection for main
#    - Add repository topics: python, ai, scaffolding, framework, modules, templates
```

### Step 2: PyPI Package Publishing (20 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Create PyPI account at pypi.org
# 2. Generate API token
# 3. Test package build
pip install build twine
python -m build

# 4. Test on TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# 5. If successful, publish to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

### Step 3: Community Infrastructure (45 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Set up GitHub repository features:
#    - Create issue templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
#    - Enable GitHub Discussions with categories
#    - Set up project boards for roadmap tracking
#    - Configure security policies

# 2. Create documentation website:
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
mkdocs new docs
# Customize docs/mkdocs.yml
mkdocs gh-deploy

# 3. Social media presence:
#    - Create Twitter account for the project
#    - LinkedIn company page (optional)
#    - Dev.to account for blog posts
```

### Step 4: Initial Launch (1 week)

```bash
# Day 1-2: Soft launch
#    - Share with close network
#    - Gather initial feedback
#    - Fix any critical issues

# Day 3-4: Community announcement
#    - Post on relevant subreddits (r/Python, r/programming)
#    - Share on Hacker News
#    - Announce on LinkedIn/Twitter

# Day 5-7: Content creation
#    - Create demo video
#    - Write blog post about AI-assisted development
#    - Prepare for community questions and feedback
```
