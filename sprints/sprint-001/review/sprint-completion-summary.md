## 🚀 Major Deliverables

### **1. Repository Structure Transformation**
Successfully transformed from ad-hoc structure to target automated agile layout:
```
src/
├── core/                    # Framework patterns and generators
├── json_pipeline/           # JSON-to-microservice engine  
├── automated_agile/         # Sprint lifecycle automation
└── module_library/          # Self-evolving module registry

sprints/sprint-001/          # Sprint artifacts and tracking
microservices/               # Generated microservices output
```

### **2. JSON-to-Microservice Pipeline**
Implemented complete pipeline from JSON specification to production-ready microservice:
- **Spec Parser**: Validates JSON against comprehensive schema
